#Solo Cello Tunez
Welcome to Solo Cello Tunez. The following arrangements are a selection of pieces composed by Joe Hisaishi and are most notably featured in various Studio Ghibli films. Once I've made my way through the list below, I plan on arranging a few video game songs. So stay tuned, and I hope you enjoy playing these arrangements!
